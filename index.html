        <h1>Responsive Web Design</h1>
        <p class="definition">
            <ul>
           <li> Responsive web design (RWD) makes sure that websites work and look well on PCs and mobile phones of all screen sizes.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p class=" why is it importance">
            <strong>Why Responsive Design(RWD) importance:</strong><br>
            my responsive design approach ensures that:
            <ul>
         <li> On large screens, the form displays in a multi-column layout, with inputs side by side.</li>
           <li> On smaller screens (like tablets and smartphones), the form fields stack vertically and adjust their width to 100% for better readability and usability.</li>
           <li> The design also adapts to the screen size by adjusting font sizes, padding, and button sizes to ensure they are easy to use on all devices.</li>
           </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="viewport">
            <strong>Explain the Use of the Viewport in Responsive Web Design:</strong><br>
            The viewport is crucial in responsive web design as it controls how a web page is displayed on different devices. Essentially, itâ€™s the visible area of a web page, and because mobile devices have smaller screens than desktops, websites need to adapt to these varying sizes to provide an optimal user experience.
        </p>
        <p class="media-queries">
            <strong>What are Media Queries?</strong><br>
            By using media queries,  ensures that  website's layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, enhancing user experience across devices.
        </p>

        <p class="media-work ">
            <strong>How does media work on my website?</strong><br>
            <ul>
           <li> On tablets and small screens (under 768px), input boxes will stack vertically, and the layout will adjust for better touch-screen interaction.</li>
          <li>On even smaller screens (under 480px), the form's padding and font sizes are further adjusted to make sure everything fits neatly.</li>
         <li>  On larger screens (over 1200px), the form becomes wider to utilize the available screen space efficiently.</li>
           </ul>
            

      <p class="max-width , min width ">
        <strong>max-width, min-width?</strong><br>

        1.max-width: This rule applies when the screen width is 768px or less, typically targeting tablets and smaller devices.<br>
        2.max-width: 480px: This rule targets screens that are 480px or less, generally targeting mobile devices.<br>
        3.min-width:  This rule applies when the screen width is 1200px or greater, typically for larger screens or desktop devices.<br>
